This is some code that was developed as part of the Documenting the Now project
at  MITH in collaboration with [Mosi Secret] to try to find relevant tweets
from activists in Ferguson who are now deceased. It relies on 4 tweet datasets
related to Ferguson and BlackLivesMatter that are available at MITH.
